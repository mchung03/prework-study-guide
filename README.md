# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation for building this website is to have a place with compiled information from the prework before attending the coding bootcamp. It solves the problem of disorganization and forgetting information as I learn. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to build this website. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section is organized into headers titled HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with information I learned during the prework. Additionally, if you open the DevTools console (right click and click Inspect), you can see the JavaScript running. It lists the topics I learned from prework and chooses one topic to study first.
